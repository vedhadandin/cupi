# Stock Broker Client Web Dashboard

## About the Project
This project is a simple real-time stock broker client web dashboard.
It allows users to log in using an email address, subscribe to selected stocks,
and view live stock price updates without refreshing the page.

The application uses simulated stock prices generated at regular intervals,
as real market data is not required for this assessment.
